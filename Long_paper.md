 An animal is placed in front of a mirror, where a researcher analyzes its action towards the mirror. After, the animal is anesthetized, and an odorless mark is placed in a body part that can normally not be seen. If the animal reacts to this odorless mark, the animal can then be considered to have the ability of self-recognition. However, it is important to note that self-recognition is not directly connected to self-awareness. Self-awareness includes parts other than the behavioral parts of an animal. However, a lot of other research suggests that animals really are self-aware, such as the case of bonobos, bottlenose dolphins, and the most recently discovered, the cleaner wrasse.
