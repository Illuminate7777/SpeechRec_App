 Hi, welcome to Waymaker Module 7. This is a bridge version or a shortened version. This is simply for the second half of Waymaker Module 7, which is public speaking. And we're going to focus on vocal variety to start out. And as we look at vocal variety, it simply means your voice. Vocal speaks to your voice and variety means various ways in which you may use your voice. Now, there's some key things to keep in mind when it comes to vocal variety. The first one we want to talk about is making sure that we practice to develop vocal variety. And that means that we're not speaking in a monotone voice. We know how to use our voice to get impact. We make sure our volume is maintained at a reasonable level where the audience doesn't feel as though you're shouting at them. You're using your voice if you want to make an emphasis to speak softer or louder to have the pitch and the resonance that you need all of those are part of vocal variety so as we look at volume you want to vary your volume because if you if it's all just high loud loud loud it becomes difficult for persons to concentrate. It's so soft, soft, soft, soft. They're difficult to hear you and difficult also to understand what you're saying. So you want to make sure you vary your vocal variety so as to impact the conversation that you're having. Pitch and resonance. Low pitch is preferred. It is said that persons who have a low pitched voice, they tend to be viewed as more professional more credible so you want to make sure that you're not thinking you're also using low resonance and that blue resonance means that your voice will sound professional and it is sound mellow and it doesn't mean that if you're a female your voice has to sound like this it just means that your voice has to have some breath and some depth to it rather than high pitch which sounds like screeching and you don't want to be sounding like so you're screeching so pitch and resonance very important important. Low pitch is preferred. And then pace. When we're nervous, we tend to go much faster. And as a result, our pace is hastened and we end up just simply running through what we're saying and the audience doesn't get it because they don't have time to digest it because you move too quickly. So manage your pace and put appropriate pausing so the audience they're able to reflect on what you're saying and appreciate what you're saying so pace is important it goes along with pause appropriate pauses are needed if you want persons to really reflect on what you're saying intonation and this is how you sound it is part of your enunciation how you sound out your words how you end your sentences if you end your sentences and you go up at the end it sounds like you're asking a question so make sure as we are looking at intonation we keep in mind that how we end our sentences if we raise our voice at the end of the sentence it may sound like you're asking a question or if we lower voice at the end of a sentence it sounds like you're giving an order monotone this is where it is flatline same tone throughout you do not want a monotone voice because it doesn't bode well it doesn't work well for the persons who are listening because if you're monotone it's very likely you are going to cause the person to fall asleep because it's the same tone and you don't want to do that so again vocal variety is important because people want to be able to hear you be able to understand you and in a way wherein you're engaging them now as we look at language choices, it's important to think about your audience. It goes back to the primary and the secondary audience. Know who your audience is. Know whether or not what you're providing is over their heads or too much for them to understand or it is underestimating your audience and therefore you're talking down to them so we want to make sure that we know who our audience is and make sure whatever we are providing meet their particular needs if you know so much about a particular issue you may become so engrossed so connected into what you're talking about you've left your audience behind so as this is an in-depth understanding can lead to oversimplification or over complication when explaining a foreign concept because you know it so well you become so excited by and you just delve right in and you've lost your audience because you have either made it way too simple or you have made it way too complicated. Stories and analogies, and we talked about analogies earlier. Stories are great to make sure we're linking with others. Telling a good story is always one way of linking with your audience. And using analogies or comparisons, that's also a good way. If you can use an analogy to explain something, it makes there's context for the listener to see what it is like when you're comparing two things. If you use images or videos, those are extremely helpful when you're making your presentation because 80% of what we remember, 80% of what we remember is from what we're able to see. So displaying images and diagrams also helps to illustrate your particular point as well as videos. This is, I'm gonna let you listen to just a portion of this and it's by, and there's a great author. And and And it's not playing but if you go Julian Sands and you look for him, you'll find the information there and it'll make it easier for you to be able to listen to and watch. It now should be playing now. Good. The human voice. It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say, I love you. And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world what i'd like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from i've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking i'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven i think are pretty large. Habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time third negativity you can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very very negative and it's hard to listen I remember one day I said to her it's October the first today and she said I know is did dreadful it's hard to listen when somebody's that negative and another form of negativity complaining well this is the national art of the uk it's it's our national sport we complain about the weather about sport about politics about everything but actually complaining is viral misery it's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions. And again, hard to listen to somebody who's being like that. Penultimate, the six of the seven. Embroidery. Exaggeration. It demeans our language actually sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? And then of course this exaggeration becomes lying, out and out lying, and we don't listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is, I think, how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course. Being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well. For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with which will increase the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices. It's true because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. And we have timbre. It's the the way your voice feels. Again the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world because you can train. Go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing song, the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's route one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word monotonic comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question. When it's actually not a question it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody which I think is a shame so let's try and break that habit pace I can get very very excited by saying something really really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize. And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys? It's a slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally volume. I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that if I startled anybody. Or I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting. Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people it might be proposing marriage asking for a raise a wedding speech whatever it is if it's really important you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up and I won't go any further into this but Julian is an excellent job. I said Julian Sanchez, to start with, is Julian Treasure. But there are some things that you will find if you just look up Julian Treasure, you'll see several of his presentations, but this one I really like because it speaks to how we can use our voice to be more effective and to be more engaging. So as we look at engagement, there are five techniques to capture and maintain an audience's attention. And the first one is surprise. You can use the art of surprise to get an audience's attention, to re-engage the audience's brain, as they say. If the audience is not expecting you to do something and you do it then people are more inclined to want to see what's going to happen next so surprise is a one that is an excellent technique in terms of getting the audience's attention or capturing the audience and maintaining audience's attention and then there suspense. And this is where you methodically, slowly build up an idea. It's like creating a verbal puzzle. And the persons who are there in the audience are willing to walk with you, listen to you, because you have intrigued them and you've pulled them along. And then we have storytelling. And we have talked a lot about storytelling in this class. And if you're able to tell a good story, can pull your audience in people love stories and if you're able to share a compelling story which is able to illustrate your particular point that you have then you are on the way to making sure your audience is fully engaged with your presentation your senses whenever you're doing a presentation you want to make sure as much as possible you engage all the senses of the persons who are in the room as much as possible. So it may require them to be doing something with their hand, to be listening, to be talking, to be doing anything that will help to make those five senses far more prominent. And then finally participation. In class I've asked persons to participate in several activities. Participation is a part of effective public speaking where the audience is not just passive but they're involved integrally into the presentation. Now as we look at audience participation there are some ways in which you can get your audience involved. One is to do a volunteer exercise where you ask for volunteers and you use those volunteers to do different aspects of your presentation. You may also want to do a survey and the survey would give you feedback from the audience in real time. And you may use poll everywhere you may use so many other software there that you can get and those software will help you to ask questions from the audience or of the audience and have the feedback to you in real time and then there is a Q&A and some of the questions you ask maybe rhetorical talk about that earlier where you don't expect an answer but others may be one where an answer is expected. And then your question and answer is an important part of your presentation because you expect your audience to be able to ask you questions. And then having persons place in groups and having them do exercises that will help them to understand or clarify some of the issues that are presented and having what we call small group exercises where individuals in the audience are broken up into several small groups where they have to work on a particular activity and therefore become more familiar with it and therefore become more familiar with it. And then as you take notes, it also helps to solidify what is being discussed. So note taking is another of your collaborative exercises that will help audiences to participate in the presentation. Now responding to questions, some key things to keep in mind when responding to questions. First, listen. into questions some key things to keep in mind when responding to question first listen before you jump to conclusion listen and we talked about this early in the semester listen to understand rather than to respond so we want to make sure we're listening to understand before we listen to respond because when you listen to respond you're losing that understanding that you are working on so we want to make sure that we are listening to understand rather than listening to respond now there's some I gave it a handout which looks at the some anxieties and fears that you may face as you do your public speaking and part of those anxieties come from things like not knowing your topic not be not practicing enough not being organized in other words if you take Aristotle's logos ethos and paces in mind you will be able to make an effective presentation you know your topic you'll be organized, you'll practice, practice, practice, and you will make sure that you visualize your success and that you breathe slowly, you pace yourself, and you manage your pause. and you manage your pause. Now, some tips to keep in mind as we wrap up this aspect of Waymaker Module 7, public speaking, is to understand the power of pathos, power of ethos, power of logos. And pathos looks at the emotion. That's the connection with the individual to the audience and to those who are there presenting. So if you understand the power of pathos, then you're better able to interact and to make connections with your audience. Believe in your message. If you don't believe in it, nobody else will. If you're yawning while you're making your message, then the message is not very clear and it's not one that you can literally feel comfortable with keep your speech brief the shorter your speeches the more powerful it will be once you start to bear away from what your original plans were then it becomes repetitive and it becomes less likely that the audience will actually find it valuable and make it memorable you may use a quotation you may use a video but something that the audience can leave a takeaway they can leave with where it's valuable for them so make it memorable now in sum make sure you understand and know the nine characteristics of effective public speakers the five steps of developing an effective speech the five techniques to capture and maintain audience attention, and the seven benefits of incorporating gestures into your speech. There's a four-step approach to managing Q&As, and there are 10 tips for managing performance anxiety. Remember, to understand the power of pathos, ethos, and logos. Believe in your message and keep your speech brief and make it memorable. So understand the message of pathos, logos, and ethos, making sure you believe in your message and keeping your speech brief and memorable.
